<h1>What Is 20-Time</h1>
<p>The origins of 20-Time can be traced back to the 1950s where 3m started their 15% project. The results of their project were masking tape and post-its. The 20-Time project we know today was started at Google. At Google they decided to have their workers have a side project that they would spend 20% of their time on. The results of this project are Gmail, Adscence, and Google news. </p>

<h1>My 20-Time Project</h1>
<p>This year's 20-Time project is about sign language and braille. My goals for this project is to write a paper on both sign language and braille. I also am hoping to make something else to go with the project such as a short video. </p>
