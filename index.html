<h1>What Is 20-Time</h1>
<p>The origins of 20-Time can be traced back to the 1950s where 3m started their 15% project. The results of their project were masking tape and post-its. The 20-Time project we know today was started at Google. At Google they decided to have their workers have a side project that they would spend 20% of their time on. The results of this project are Gmail, Adscence, and Google news. </p>

<h1>My 20-Time Project</h1>
<p>For my 20-Time project I am learning how to program my own website with html5 and Css3. My main goal for the project is to make a website that would have exceeded my own expectations. Another goal of mine is to have made an example mini site of what I learned that week and link it to my blogs. That is what I'm doing for my 20-Time project. </p>
