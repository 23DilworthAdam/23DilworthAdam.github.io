<h2> People who have a disability in one way or another have always been at a disadvantage compared to the majority. However, a French man named Valentin Hauy lessened the gap for some. He opened the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles which in English is the Institute for Blind Youth. It was a school that made it’s own way to use books. Hauy made a raised letter alphabet, so the blind could read the textbooks.
<P>45 years later, a student at one of his schools, designed a new system for the blind to read. This man’s name was Louis Braille. He based his system off of a coding method, that was intended for the army, called sonography. It was meant to be used for messaging without lights, but Braille had a different use for it. He made a system that had blocks made of 6 dots. His system was better than Hauy’s as it didn’t require as much space. Overall Braille’s system had 63 characters, and it could be read rapidly with fingertips.</P>
Braille’s creation has made many people’s lives better by giving them something they needed. Countless people have gotten a better education. Books that they would’ve never been able to read were read. All of these lives were changed for the better due to Valentin Hauy making a school for the blind many years ago.
